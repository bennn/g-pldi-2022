I thought about your unpublished research contribution in your thesis and came up with a thesis approach. 

Instead of tackling it from a “performance” angle, which may get attacked by
“performance knights” on a PC, you could try the idea of “let’s generalize
along a different dimension”.  And then we can ask the question “are there
benefits” and you can explain both “more programs run” and “you don’t die when
you migrate”.  

I sketched it out via a 2-slide diagram. The PDF is attached. You could try to
write an introduction like I did for the ICFP experience paper. Your best bet
is to work toward POPL in July. But get started soon. Time will fly once you
work with Shriram. 



### 2021-02-10 outline + intro

- from 2 to 3 and why
- background and constraints
- why TR
- why Natural, why Transient ... which semantics cannot fit? migratory
- model and proofs
- implementation, compiler reuse (brief), boundary challenges
  + unclear what's of general interest here
- benefits catalog
- taking stock
  + can be done
  + surprising benefits, esp. expressiveness, call for user studies
  + surprising lack of N T synergy
    . look for new compromise semantics (seems unlikely)
    . find better combo
  + ... any more?
