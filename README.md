I thought about your unpublished research contribution in your thesis and came up with a thesis approach. 

Instead of tackling it from a “performance” angle, which may get attacked by
“performance knights” on a PC, you could try the idea of “let’s generalize
along a different dimension”.  And then we can ask the question “are there
benefits” and you can explain both “more programs run” and “you don’t die when
you migrate”.  

I sketched it out via a 2-slide diagram. The PDF is attached. You could try to
write an introduction like I did for the ICFP experience paper. Your best bet
is to work toward POPL in July. But get started soon. Time will fly once you
work with Shriram.
