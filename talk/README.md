- gradual typing many forms

- impasse unless change language

- what to do?
  ... ORTHOGONAL to these, interoperate with weaker semantics

- naive interop = duh
  - gotta have example here
  - ... typed to typed is NOT going to work

- challenge ... gotta keep the properties ... so now what is the properties?
  ... (come from prior work, don't really say that)
  ... ?? example ??

- attempt 1 = failure = naive, CM explains why it fails
  attempt 2 = failure = ???, should we even get into others?
  ... no I think not
  zoom to something that does work = W S N

- how know it works?
  ... nothing sneaks into deep without a wrapper
  ... ditto nothing exits without "protection"

- implemented for TR
  [[ release info??? ]]
  now programming in another world

- guarantees ... obvious ... this is part of the new world, premise

- performance

- expressiveness ... remarkable ... incidental?
  occurrence typing hey its research ... sidestepping research questions

- in conclusion
  gt strategies can coexist and presserve formal properties
  first mix, quite promising with perf + expr and more to come (better perf)
   reminder: orthogonal
  other mixes well worth exploring, whole new regime
